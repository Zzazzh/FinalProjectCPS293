# Fall 2024 - Intro to Game Design @ SUNY New Paltz
* Name: Zachary Lopane
* [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/mR0VP2jR/final-project-todo)
* [Proposal](https://sunynp-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/lopanez1_newpaltz_edu/EUyNeUgwA89Eg0DhCEoWlqMBaKKF7h58ouXLQZuGPFgYVA?e=D5vsW4)

## 2024-10-8 3r: implement attack
* [added draft animation] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EVHNbgQCBg)
* created draft pixel art attack to see in debug
* reworked animation sprite, and reset animation scene
* fixed bug where player would automatically move left upon start (and clip through player bounds)

## 2024-10-7 1.5hr: implement killzone (failed)
* began creating kill zone to automatically respawn enemies when they reach the center of the playerbounds
* ran into issues with enemy spawning, tried reloading godot project and ran into a "missing dependencies" error
* reassigned sprites and scenes and had to redo "enemy" scene in order to resolve issue

## 2024-10-1 2hr: Added enemy spawning
* finished implementing playerbounds that allowed enemies (and not players) to pass through
* created ui button to spawn enemies randomly along 2D path

## 2024-09-29 .75hr: Worked on adding "Player Bounds" + added controller functionality
* added draft background (color rect) to make player bound more visible
* tried to convert sprite 2D ring to collision Shape
* Created 4 2D polygon collision shapes, to make a ring that players cannot cross

## 2024-09-24 1.75hr: Worked on Player Movement
* [Youtube Tutorial, Your First 2D GAME From Zero with GODOT 4! Vampire Survivor Style] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwCiGixlqiU)
* used this as a template for top player movement 
* Created a draft version of a player sprite to see if movement controls are working
#### Set up Final Project
* Set Up github repo w/ readme and devlog
* Set up godot project locally and pushed to GitHub 
* Searched for 2D Assets--to no success yet-- on itch.io
* Download Export Template
